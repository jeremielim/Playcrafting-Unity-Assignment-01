//this decides what to show the player.
//it uses a "pull" or "polling" style of showing data.
//in other words, it constantly checks to see what data there is, and
//changes what it's showing based on what it finds.
//The opposite is called "pushing" data. When the player takes damage,
//he would tell the GameGUI to update its UI.
//The advantage to polling is that data is nicely encapsulated, so the
//core game functions with or without the UI existing.
//The disadvantage to polling is that it's less efficient, since we
//are constantly making calls every single frame.
